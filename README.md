# Google Maps 

Due to my work and personal life, I only had 4 hours to work on this test. In 3 hours of work I managed to implement the MVP for this project.

The MVP for this project were as follows:

In the webpage: 
- Use the Google Maps API to create a map
- Create an input field for an address
- A button to submit


When entering an address through either the enter key or clicking the button, a marker is then placed onto the address' location.
When entering a new address the marker as well as the map position changes to the new address' location. 


## Design and Stack Articulation

I made the decision to use Redux in case I wanted to use what I learned in this project to a larger scale application in the future.
Along with this, I decided to use map-gl to create a map for me incase I wanted to use their rich selection of overlays in the future.  
Finally, I decided to include google places-autocomplete to enhance user experience.
